This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.3.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## What we are looking for:

**CSS Skills:** Create your own CSS or style object for UI (don't use a UI library like Bootstrap or ant design)

**Code Design:** We are keen to understand how you design and structure your code

**Tests:** We value unit testing. Tests for your components will be a bonus

**Responsive UI** We would love to see how the app works on different screen sizes

**Simplicity:** We value simplicity as an architectural virtue. Your solutions should reflect the difficulty of the assigned task, and should not be overly complex. Layers of abstraction, patterns, or architectural features that aren't called for should not be included.

#### How do I submit ?

When you are done with the solution and have pushed it to the repo, [you can submit the assignment here](https://app.snapcode.review/submission_links/2be6ddea-4396-41d0-b7d4-7182c03ed59e)
